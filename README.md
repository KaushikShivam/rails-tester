# Warmup: Sending Params with RestClient

In this project, I got a chance to interact with a Rails application from the command line by sending requests manually. I built a very simple app (to get some practice with the steps involved in creating a new one) and then a simple script which used the RestClient gem to send some requests and examine the server output.
